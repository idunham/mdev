mdev (0.6-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Bugfix: /lib/mdev/disk_link.sh tried to optimize by doing multiple
    devices at once when called from mdev -s.
    To make this efficient, we used a lockfile.
    The net effect was that when seeding an empty /dev, disk_link.sh
    would do nothing.

mdev (0.6-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Fix "co-exist with udev" logic.
    The initial version was absolutely worthless, except that it did
    make the problems obvious.
