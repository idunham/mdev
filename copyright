mdev.conf and most of the helper scripts (dvbdev, usbdev, xvd_links)
come from the Alpine Linux busybox-initscripts package; mdev.conf was
slightly adjusted, while the helpers are unmodified.
These are licensed under the GPL, version 2; on a Debian system, you
can find the text of the GPL at:

All the initramfs hooks, the mdev init script, and the disk_link.sh helper
script were written from scratch by Isaac Dunham, and are public domain
without warranty.

The Xorg configuration files (xorg.conf.d/*) come from mdev-like-a-boss,
